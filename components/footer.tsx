          Contracts for Difference (CFDs) are leveraged products and can result
          in losses that exceed deposits. You should understand how leveraged
          trading works before taking the decision to invest in margin
          instruments. CFD trading carries a high level of risk and may not be
          suitable for everyone, so please ensure you fully understand the risks
          involved before trading.
